# Advanced Recommender Systems Project

Wrote material for the course available on Coursera ["Advanced Recommender Systems"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-recommender-systems/home/welcome) for EIT Digital & Politecnico di Milano. 

In particular I was asked to review and revise the first week of the course and use Amazon Polly (AWS) to turn text into lifelike speech.
