##### Challenge Intro

You will have until the 2 weeks to solve a visual question answering (VQA) problem on the proposed dataset, which contains synthetic scenes composed by several objects and corresponding questions about the *existence* of something in the scene (e.g., Is there a yellow thing?') or about *counting* (e.g., How many big objects are there?') . Given an image and a question, the goal is to provide the correct *answer*.
