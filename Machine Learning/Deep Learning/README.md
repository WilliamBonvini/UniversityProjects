# Kaggle Challenges 

In this folder you'll find 3 Kaggle challenges I took part in for the course Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning as taught in Politecnico di Milano during the academic year 2019/2020.

The challenges are 

- Image Classification
- Image Segmentation
- Visual Question Answering

They were all solved using Tensorflow 2 and Keras.
