# Debiasing Project 

The overall goal of the work is to analyze the gender bias dimension in a word embedding context, to then pair it with other dimensions that are commonly sources of other stereotypes and biases, such as ethnicity and sexual orientation. Based on this, we then aim at proposing a way to incorporate in the analysis an overall ”ethic” dimension, which should suitably encompass all the others mentioned above and possibly more.

We do so by summarizing 4 papers on the topic and draw conclusions on how to measure and remove bias in word embeddings.
