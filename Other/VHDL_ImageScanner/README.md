# Logical Networks

This project consists in synthesizing a hardware component in VHDL that, inputted a grey-scale image, returns the area of a specific rectangle within it.

The image is represented as a matrix of integers (8 bits per integer).  
The input consists in

- length of matrix
- width of matrix
- threshold value
- matrix

The area to be returned corresponds to the minimum area within the matrix whose elements are all equal or above the threshold value.

An exhaustive description of the project can be found in the pdf "documentation".
