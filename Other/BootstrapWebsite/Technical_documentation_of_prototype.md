## General description of your project + division of work   

Our project consists in a care center for children with disabilities, as requested by the course.   
We created on average 4/5 single topic pages for each category (people, events...) and connected all the pages among them.  


Usability:   
We always gathered to discuss about the usability issues.  
tests were performed separately.  
The document was written by Matteo Frigerio and Leonardo Barilani, after discussing it with the rest of the team.  


Scenarios:  
Scenarios were created by the whole team.  


Design in the large:  
We always gathered to write it.  
It was rarely and individually edited afterwards, but always with the approval of each component of the team.  


Design in the small:   
designed by the whole team, documents created by Matteo Frigerio.  


DB Design:   
Designed by Leonardo Barilani and subsequently corrected by the whole team.  


Design document:   
Made by Leonardo Barilani and Matteo Frigerio.  


Heroku and bitbucket deployment:   
Done by Leonardo Barilani.  

Front end:   
Developed by the whole team, particularly William Bonvini created the homepage, the navbar containing the landmarks, the css pages, single topics and google maps.   
The rest of the team connected the pages, created the link pages (operatingin, who, where, ...) and the rest of the pages.  

Technical Documentation of Prototype:
Made by William Bonvini and approved by the rest of the team.

Responsiveness:
Was checked by William Bonvini, paying attention to font-sizes and symmetrical placement of the components.  



## Client-side languages used:  
We mainly used bootstrap 4 to develop our project, particularly we used the grid-system, margin and padding settings, height and width settings and buttons.  
CSS was used to perform some fixes such as card colors and alignment, and obviously inside the JavaScript.  
With CSS we created a few ids which have been helpful in setting different margin distances depending on the screen size.   
JavaScript was useful to improve the responsiveness of our site, since we setted different font-sizes for different screen sizes.  
html was used in support of bootstrap and for some minor fixes, and obviously for connecting links and images.   


## Templates used:  

homepage:  
https://blackrockdigital.github.io/startbootstrap-small-business/  


single topics of "people":  
https://blackrockdigital.github.io/startbootstrap-portfolio-item/  


single topics of the remaining ones:  
https://blackrockdigital.github.io/startbootstrap-blog-post/ 


We started from these three templates but we actually deleted good part of them and made pages from scratch.   
They were helpful for the presence of bootstrap cards.  

  


## External vendors' scripts/plugins used and url:  
We used:  
Bootstrap 4 --> https://getbootstrap.com/  
Jquery      --> https://jquery.com/  
Google Maps --> https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial    


## List of the main problems we faced during the development     
Unfortunately we didn't realize we had to upload on bitbucket each of our commits until 4 days ago.  
Though we worked on a GitHub repository since the beginning of the course.  
Sorry for the inconvenience, we will obviously share the Github repository if asked.  
Moreover we did not organize in the best possible way the folders in our project, and we created more than one css, because we thought it would have been clearer  
which page used what property.    
Since we created more than 40 pages we didn't manage to organize in a proper way the folders, but we will surely do it for the second deadline.
